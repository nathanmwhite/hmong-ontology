# hmong-ontology
A semantic ontology resource for the Hmong language, inspired by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).

This repository currently contains the following files:
1. hmong_ontology.xml : The xml file containing the lexemes (nouns and verbs) and their semantic categories.
2. stopwords_base.txt : A text file containing Hmong stopwords, excluding classifiers and verbal bound roots/affixes.
3. stopwords_classifiers.txt : A text file containing Hmong classifiers.
4. stopwords_verbal_adjuncts.txt : A text file containing Hmong verbal adjuncts, such as bound roots and affixes.

TODO:
1. Create Python code to load the Hmong ontology as a WordNet-style library.
